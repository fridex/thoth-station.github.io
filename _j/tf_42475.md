title: TensorFlow in version <=2.4 is slow when tf.keras.layers.Embedding is used
---

Using the embedding layer can significantly slow down backward propagation.

## Issue description

Using ``tf.keras.layers.Embedding`` can significantly slow down backwards
propagation (up to 20 times). This is caused by a bug which is not yet fixed
in TensorFlow upstream.

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow<=2.4``
 * ``tensorflow-cpu<=2.4``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu<=2.4``
 * ``intel-tensorflow<=2.4``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

TensorFlow upstream does not have a fix yet. If the Embedding layer is
important to you from performace point of view, switch to alternative
libraries, such as PyTorch.

## Pipeline units

 * [TensorFlowSlowKerasEmbedding](https://thoth-station.ninja/docs/developers/adviser/thoth.adviser.wraps.html#thoth.adviser.wraps.TensorFlowSlowKerasEmbedding)
