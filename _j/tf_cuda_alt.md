title: Considering also tensorflow-gpu package as the runtime environment used provides CUDA
---

The resolution process is also considering [``tensorflow-gpu``][1] package as
an alternative to [``tensorflow``][2] package.

## Issue description

The runtime environment used provides CUDA which enables running
[``tensorflow-gpu``][1]. The resolution process will include package
[``tensorflow-gpu``][1] as an alternative to [``tensorflow``][2].

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

Resolver will automatically consider package ``tensorflow-gpu`` as an
alternative to ``tensorflow`` considering the version range specification as
stated for the tensorflow dependency.
