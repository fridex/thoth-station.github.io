title: Not recommending TensorFlow in version X as this version is not supported on CUDA in version Y
---

The resolution process did not take into account a specific TensorFlow release
as the given TensorFlow release is not tested with CUDA version present in the
runtime environment.

## Issue description

TensorFlow is supported with specific CUDA versions. See supported
[TensorFlow/CUDA matrix][1] to make sure TensorFlow works with CUDA installed
in the runtime environment.

## Affected packages:

 * ``tensorflow``
 * ``tensorflow-gpu``

## Severity

 * WARNING

## Issue fix

The resolution process resolves a TensorFlow release that is suitable for the
runtime environment with a specific CUDA version on its own. Unless TensorFlow
is pinned to a specific release in which case the resolution fails.

## Recommendation types

 * performance
 * security
 * stable

listed](http://thoth-station.ninja/recommendation-types).
